        <p>Rowlet can attack without making a sound! It flies silently through the skies, drawing near to its opponent without being noticed, and then lashing out with powerful kicks. It can also attack from a distance using the razor-sharp leaves that form part of its feathers.</p>

            <br>
            When the time comes for Litten to shed its old fur, it all burns up in a glorious blaze.

        <h3>Popplio</h3>
        <p>Popplio the Sea Lion Pokémon. Popplio is one of the three starter Pokemon of the Alola region. The japanese name of Popplio is Ashimari</p>
        <p>Popplio's swimming speed is known to exceed 25 mph. It's better at moving in the water than on land. Still, when it's on land, it takes advantage of the elasticity of its balloons to perform acrobatic stunts and jumps.</p>
        <p>
            Popplio can snort out balloons made of water! Watch it spin water balloons into a playful battle strategy!
            <br>
            Both frivolous and hard-working, Popplio can easily get carried away—unleashing enough power in battle to make quite a spectacle! But Popplio’s determined spirit means it can usually be found practicing hard on its balloon skills.
            <br>
            The Water Gun move attacks an opponent by firing a jet of water. Popplio knows this move from the moment it becomes your partner!
